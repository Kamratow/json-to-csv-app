# json-to-csv-app

An app that allows user to download data in csv format

Before starting the app please remember create `.env` file and fill it in with necessary data, for example:

```
API_KEY="your_api_key"
API_URL="api_url"
API_VERSION=api_version_you_will_use
PORT=port_number_goes_here
```

Then you need to install all dependencies using this command (for npm users):

```
npm install
```

When you will have all the prerequisites provided above ready you can start server using this command:

```
npm start
```

In order to start interacting with the frontend part simply access index page, for localhost with port 3000 this would be:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
